    "### Results and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis shows that although there is a great number of restaurants in Chicago,  we mainly focused in New City, Chicago with in the radius of 500 from the respective distances.  From the above analysis we can say that the area that are closer to the location got less number of pizza place.  So, it is better to open a pizza place close to those particular locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of this project was to identify New City areas close to  center with low number of restaurants (particularly Pizza Place) in order to aid stakeholders in narrowing down the search for optimal location for a new Pizza Place. By calculating restaurant density distribution from Foursquare data we have further analysis using clusters. Final decision on optimal restaurant location will be made by stakeholders based on specific characteristics of neighborhoods and locations in every recommended zone, taking into consideration additional factors like population, of very neighborhood etc.\n"
